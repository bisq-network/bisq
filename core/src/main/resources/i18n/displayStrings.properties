# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

  trade. For BSQ, only confirmed BSQ are counted.\n\n\
  In case the maker's wallet does not have enough funds, the offer is automatically \
  removed from the offer book and added back once the wallet has sufficient funds again.

  By accepting, you sign the proposed payout transaction. \
  If your trading peer also accepts and signs, the payout will be completed, and the trade will be closed.\n\n\
  If one or both of you reject the suggestion, you will have to wait until {2} (block {3}) to open a \
  second-round dispute with an arbitrator who will investigate the case again and do a payout based on their findings.\n\n\
  The arbitrator may charge a small fee (fee maximum: the trader''s security deposit) as compensation for their work. \
  Both traders agreeing to the mediator''s suggestion is the happy path—requesting arbitration is meant for \
  exceptional circumstances, such as if a trader is sure the mediator did not make a fair payout suggestion \
  (or if the other peer is unresponsive).\n\n\

portfolio.pending.failedTrade.buyer.existingDepositTxButMissingDelayedPayoutTx=The delayed payout transaction is missing, \
  but funds have been locked in the deposit transaction.\n\n\
  Please do NOT send the fiat or altcoin payment to the BTC seller, because without the delayed payout tx, arbitration \
  cannot be opened. Instead, open a mediation ticket with Cmd/Ctrl+o. \
  The mediator should suggest that both peers each get back the full amount of their security deposits \
  (with seller receiving full trade amount back as well). \

support.backgroundInfo=Bisq is not a company, so it handles disputes differently.\n\n\
Traders can communicate within the application via secure chat on the open trades screen to try solving disputes on their own. \

  payout of trade funds. If both traders accept this suggestion, the payout transaction is completed and the trade is closed. \
  If one or both traders do not agree to the mediator's suggested payout, they can request arbitration.\
  The arbitrator will re-evaluate the situation and, if warranted, personally pay the trader back and request reimbursement \
  for this payment from the Bisq DAO.

  For users who are regularily using Bisq this should not be an issue as there are not many blocks pending for parsing, though for \
  users who only use Bisq casually creating the DAO state hashes for 100s or 1000s of blocks degrades heavily the user experience.\n\n\
  In case full-mode is deactivated (default) the missing DAO state hashes are requested from network nodes and \
  the DAO state hash based on the most recent block will be created by the user. As all hashes are connected by \
  reference to the previous hash a correct hash at the chain tip means that all past hashes are correct as well. The \

account.altcoin.popup.blk-burnt.msg=To trade burnt blackcoins, you need to know the following:\n\n\
Burnt blackcoins are unspendable. To trade them on Bisq, output scripts need to be in the form: \
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA, followed by associated data bytes which, after being hex-encoded, constitute addresses. \
For example, burnt blackcoins with an address 666f6f (“foo” in UTF-8) will have the following script:\n\n\
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA 666f6f\n\n\
To create burnt blackcoins, one may use the “burn” RPC command available in some wallets.\n\n\
For possible use cases, one may look at https://ibo.laboratorium.ee .\n\n\
As burnt blackcoins are unspendable, they can not be reselled. “Selling” burnt blackcoins means \
burning ordinary blackcoins (with associated data equal to the destination address).\n\n\

You should write down the seed words on a sheet of paper. Do not save them on your computer.\n\n\
Please note that the seed words are NOT a replacement for a backup.\n\
You need to create a backup of the whole application directory from the \"Account/Backup\" screen to recover application state and data.\n\
Importing seed words is only recommended for emergency cases. The application will not be functional without a proper backup of the database files and keys!

  previous application state.\n\n\
  After restoring the application will shut down automatically. After you have restarted the application it will resync \
  with the Bitcoin network. This can take a while and can consume a lot of CPU, especially if the wallet was older and \
  had many transactions. Please avoid interrupting that process, otherwise you might need to delete the SPV chain file \
  again or repeat the restore process.
account.seed.restore.ok=Ok, do the restore and shut down Bisq

payment.clearXchange.info=Zelle is a money transfer service that works best *through* another bank.\n\n\
  1. Check this page to see if (and how) your bank works with Zelle: [HYPERLINK:https://www.zellepay.com/get-started]\n\n\
  2. Take special note of your transfer limits—sending limits vary by bank, and banks often specify separate daily, weekly, and monthly limits.\n\n\
  3. If your bank does not work with Zelle, you can still use it through the Zelle mobile app, but your transfer limits will be much lower.\n\n\
  4. The name specified on your Bisq account MUST match the name on your Zelle/bank account. \n\n\
  If you cannot complete a Zelle transaction as specified in your trade contract, you may lose some (or all) of your security deposit.\n\n\
  Because of Zelle''s somewhat higher chargeback risk, sellers are advised to contact unsigned buyers through email or SMS to verify that the buyer \
  really owns the Zelle account specified in Bisq.
payment.fasterPayments.newRequirements.info=Some banks have started verifying the receiver''s full name for Faster \
  Payments transfers. Your current Faster Payments account does not specify a full name.\n\n\

  When you recreate the account, make sure to copy the precise sort code, account number and account age verification \
  salt values from your old account to your new account. This will ensure your existing account''s age and signing \
  status are preserved.
payment.moneyGram.info=When using MoneyGram the BTC buyer has to send the Authorisation number and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \

payment.westernUnion.info=When using Western Union the BTC buyer has to send the MTCN (tracking number) and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \

payment.halCash.info=When using HalCash the BTC buyer needs to send the BTC seller the HalCash code via a text message from their mobile phone.\n\n\
  Please make sure to not exceed the maximum amount your bank allows you to send with HalCash. \
  The min. amount per withdrawal is 10 EUR and the max. amount is 600 EUR. For repeated withdrawals it is \
  3000 EUR per receiver per day and 6000 EUR per receiver per month. Please cross check those limits with your \
  bank to be sure they use the same limits as stated here.\n\n\
  The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10 EUR as you cannot withdraw other amounts from an ATM. The \
  UI in the create-offer and take-offer screen will adjust the BTC amount so that the EUR amount is correct. You cannot use market \
  based price as the EUR amount would be changing with changing prices.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute the BTC buyer needs to provide the proof that they sent the EUR.

Users who have registered with only their email, name, and phone number have the following limits:\n\n\
  ● $100 maximum per deposit\n\
  ● $1,000 maximum total deposits per week\n\
  ● $100 maximum per payment\n\n\

  ● $1,000 maximum per deposit\n\
  ● $1,000 maximum total deposits per week\n\
  ● $1,000 maximum per payment\n\n\

The maximum trade size is $1,000 per payment.\n\n\
If you trade over the above limits your trade might be cancelled and there could be a penalty.

payment.transferwiseUsd.info.account=Due US banking regulation, sending and receiving USD payments has more restrictions \
  than most other currencies. For this reason USD was not added to Bisq TransferWise payment method.\n\n\
The TransferWise-USD payment method allows Bisq users to trade in USD.\n\n\
Anyone with a Wise, formally TransferWise account, can add TransferWise-USD as a payment method in Bisq. This will \
  allow them to buy and sell BTC with USD.\n\n\
When trading on Bisq BTC Buyers should not use any reference for reason for payment. If reason for payment is required \
  they should only use the full name of the TransferWise-USD account owner.
payment.transferwiseUsd.info.buyer=Please send payment only to the email address in the BTC Seller's Bisq TransferWise-USD account.
payment.transferwiseUsd.info.seller=Please check that the payment received matches the BTC Buyer's name of the TransferWise-USD account in Bisq.

payment.usPostalMoneyOrder.info=Trading using US Postal Money Orders (USPMO) on Bisq requires that you understand the following:\n\
\n\
- BTC buyers must write the BTC Seller’s name in both the Payer and the Payee’s fields & take a high-resolution photo of the USPMO and envelope with proof of tracking before sending.\n\
- BTC buyers must send the USPMO to the BTC seller with Delivery Confirmation.\n\
\n\
In the event mediation is necessary, or if there is a trade dispute, you will be required to send the photos to the Bisq mediator or refund agent, together with the USPMO Serial Number, Post Office Number, and dollar amount, so they can verify the details on the US Post Office website.\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the Mediator or Arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case.\n\n\
In all dispute cases, the USPMO sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in providing evidence/proof to the Mediator or Arbitrator.\n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using USPMO on Bisq.

payment.cashByMail.info=Trading using cash-by-mail (CBM) on Bisq requires that you understand the following:\n\
  \n\
  ● BTC buyer should package cash in a tamper-evident cash bag.\n\
  ● BTC buyer should film or take high-resolution photos of the cash packaging process with the address & tracking number already affixed to packaging.\n\
  ● BTC buyer should send the cash package to the BTC seller with Delivery Confirmation and appropriate Insurance.\n\
  ● BTC seller should film the opening of the package, making sure that the tracking number provided by the sender is visible in the video.\n\
  ● Offer maker must state any special terms or conditions in the 'Additional Information' field of the payment account.\n\
  ● Offer taker agrees to the offer maker's terms and conditions by taking the offer.\n\
  \n\
  CBM trades put the onus to act honestly squarely on both peers.\n\
  \n\
  ● CBM trades have less verifiable actions than other fiat trades. This makes handling dispute much harder.\n\
  ● Try to resolve disputes directly with your peer using trader chat. This is your most promising route to solving any CBM dispute.\n\
  ● Mediators can consider your case and make a suggestion, but they are NOT guaranteed to help.\n\
  ● If a mediator is engaged, and if either peer rejects the mediator's suggestion, both peers' funds will be sent to a Bisq 'donation' address [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Arbitration#Time-Locked_Payout_Transaction], and the trade will effectively be completed.\n\
  ● If a trader rejects a mediation suggestion and opens arbitration, it could lead to a loss of both the trading and the deposit funds.\n\
  ● Arbitrators will make a decision based on the evidence provided to them. Therefore, please follow and document the above processes to have evidence in case of dispute. For Cash by Mail trades the Arbitrators decision is final.\n\
  ● Reimbursement requests any lost funds resulting from Cash By Mail trades to the Bisq DAO will NOT be considered.\n\
  \n\
  To be sure you fully understand the requirements of cash-by-mail trades, please see: [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Cash_by_Mail]\n\
  \n\
  If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade using CBM on Bisq.

Country you are located (eg France); \n\
Countries / regions you would accept trades from (eg France, EU, or any European country); \n\
Any special terms/conditions; \n\
Any other details.
payment.cashByMail.tradingRestrictions=Please review the maker's terms and conditions.\n\
  If you do not meet the requirements do not take this trade.
payment.f2f.info='Face to Face' trades have different rules and come with different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  The main differences are:\n\
  ● The trading peers need to exchange information about the meeting location and time by using their provided contact details.\n\
  ● The trading peers need to bring their laptops and do the confirmation of 'payment sent' and 'payment received' at the meeting place.\n\
  ● If a maker has special 'terms and conditions' they must state those in the 'Additional information' text field in the account.\n\
  ● By taking an offer the taker agrees to the maker's stated 'terms and conditions'.\n\
  ● In case of a dispute the mediator or arbitrator cannot be of much assistance as it is usually difficult to get tamper-proof evidence \
  of what happened at the meeting. In such cases the BTC funds might get locked indefinitely or until the trading peers come to \
  an agreement.\n\n\
  To be sure you fully understand the differences with 'Face to Face' trades please read the instructions and \
  recommendations at: [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Face-to-face_(payment_method)]

payment.amazonGiftCard.info=To pay with Amazon eGift Card, you will need to send an Amazon eGift Card to the BTC seller via your Amazon account. \n\n\
  Please see the wiki [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/Amazon_eGift_card] for further details and best practices. \n\n\
  Three important notes:\n\
  - try to send gift cards with amounts of 100 USD or smaller, as Amazon is known to flag larger gift cards as fraudulent\n\
  - try to use creative, believable text for the gift card''s message (e.g., "Happy birthday Susan!") and use trader chat \
  to tell your trading peer the reference text you picked so they can verify your payment\n\
  - Amazon eGift Cards can only be redeemed on the Amazon website they were purchased on (e.g., a gift card purchased on amazon.it can only be redeemed on amazon.it)

news.bsqSwap.title=New trade protocol: BSQ SWAPS
news.bsqSwap.description=BSQ swaps is a new trade protocol for atomically swapping BSQ and BTC in a single \
  transaction.\n\n\
  This saves miner fees, allows instant trades, removes counterparty risk, and does not require \
  mediation or arbitration support. No account setup is required either.\n\n\
  See more about BSQ swaps in documentation [HYPERLINK:https://bisq.wiki/BSQ_swaps].

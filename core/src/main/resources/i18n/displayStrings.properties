# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

  If your trading peer also accepts and signs, the payout will be completed, and the trade will be closed.\n\n\
  If one or both of you reject the suggestion, you will have to wait until {2} (block {3}) to open a \
  second-round dispute with an arbitrator who will investigate the case again and do a payout based on their findings.\n\n\
  The arbitrator may charge a small fee (fee maximum: the trader''s security deposit) as compensation for their work. \
  Both traders agreeing to the mediator''s suggestion is the happy path—requesting arbitration is meant for \
  exceptional circumstances, such as if a trader is sure the mediator did not make a fair payout suggestion \
  (or if the other peer is unresponsive).\n\n\

support.backgroundInfo=Bisq is not a company, so it handles disputes differently.\n\n\
Traders can communicate within the application via secure chat on the open trades screen to try solving disputes on their own. \
  If that is not sufficient, a mediator can step in to help. The mediator will evaluate the situation and suggest a \
  payout of trade funds. If both traders accept this suggestion, the payout transaction is completed and the trade is closed. \
  If one or both traders do not agree to the mediator's suggested payout, they can request arbitration.\
  The arbitrator will re-evaluate the situation and, if warranted, personally pay the trader back and request reimbursement \
  for this payment from the Bisq DAO.
support.initialInfo=Please enter a description of your problem in the text field below. \
  Add as much information as possible to speed up dispute resolution time.\n\n\
  Here is a check list for information you should provide:\n\
  \t● If you are the BTC buyer: Did you make the Fiat or Altcoin transfer? If so, did you click the 'payment started' \
  button in the application?\n\
  \t● If you are the BTC seller: Did you receive the Fiat or Altcoin payment? If so, did you click the 'payment received' \
  button in the application?\n\
  \t● Which version of Bisq are you using?\n\
  \t● Which operating system are you using?\n\
  \t● If you encountered an issue with failed transactions please consider switching to a new data directory.\n\
  \t  Sometimes the data directory gets corrupted and leads to strange bugs. \n\
  \t  See: https://docs.bisq.network/backup-recovery.html#switch-to-a-new-data-directory\n\n\
  Please make yourself familiar with the basic rules for the dispute process:\n\
\t● You need to respond to the {0}''s requests within 2 days.\n\
\t● Mediators respond in between 2 days. Arbitrators respond in between 5 business days.\n\
\t● The maximum period for a dispute is 14 days.\n\
\t● You need to cooperate with the {1} and provide the information they request to make your case.\n\

- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \

or the ArQmA forum (https://labs.arqma.com) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=Trading XMR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
Prove payments: since Monero is a private coin, some transaction details aren't publicly available \
in the blockchain, and, in case of a dispute, the mediator or arbitrator needs them to check if the \
transaction was really made. In Bisq, the sender of the XMR transaction is the one responsible for \
providing this information to the mediator or arbitrator in case of a dispute. In order to do that, \
you must send XMR using a wallet that provides the information required to prove the payment was made, \
which includes:\n\n\
- the transaction key (Tx Key, Tx Secret Key or Tx Private Key)\n\
- the transaction ID (Tx ID or Tx Hash)\n\
- the destination address (recipient's address)\n\n\
This information can be found in the official Monero GUI & CLI wallets, MyMonero, and Exodus (desktop) \
as well as in Cake Wallet, MyMonero, and Monerujo (mobile), in the following locations:\n\n\
- Monero GUI: go to Transactions tab\n\
- Monero CLI: use the command get_tx_key TXID. The flag store-tx-info must be enabled (enabled by default in new versions)\n\
- Other wallets: go to Transactions history and search for Transaction key (Tx key or Secret key) and the destination address \
in a sent transaction. Save recipient address option must be enabled in Cake Wallet settings.\n\n\
If you are using a wallet different from the mentioned above, please be sure you can access those three pieces of information.\
Since the transaction key and the destination address are stored in the Monero wallet software, and they cannot be recovered \
in the Monero blockchain, you should never delete or restore your Monero wallet before a Bisq trade is completed. Failure to \
provide the above data will result in losing the dispute case.\n\n\
Check payments: with those three pieces of information, the verification that a quantity of Monero was sent to a specific \
address can be accomplished the following way:\n\n\
- Monero GUI: change wallet to Advanced mode and go to Advanced > Prove/check > Check Transaction\n\
- Monero CLI: use the command check_tx_key TXID TXKEY ADDRESS\n\
- XMR checktx tool (https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html)\n\
- Explore Monero website (https://www.exploremonero.com/receipt)\n\n\
If you are still not sure about this process, visit (https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html) \
to find more information or ask a question on the Monero support subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/monerosupport/).

account.altcoin.popup.msr.msg=Trading MSR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending MSR, you need to use either the official Masari GUI wallet, Masari CLI wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (enabled by default) or the Masari web wallet (https://wallet.getmasari.org). Please be sure you can access the tx key as \
that would be required in case of a dispute.\n\

Verification can be accomplished in-wallet.\n\
masari-wallet-cli : using command (check_tx_key).\n\
masari-wallet-gui : on the Advanced > Prove/Check page.\n\
Verification can be accomplished in the block explorer \n\
Open block explorer (https://explorer.getmasari.org), use the search bar to find your transaction hash.\n\
Once transaction is found, scroll to bottom to the 'Prove Sending' area and fill in details as needed.\n\
You need to provide the mediator or arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The MSR sender is responsible for providing verification of the MSR transfer to the \
mediator or arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\

account.altcoin.popup.blur.msg=Trading BLUR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
To send BLUR you must use the Blur Network CLI or GUI Wallet. \n\n\
If you are using the CLI wallet, a transaction hash (tx ID) will be displayed after a transfer is sent. You must save \
this information. Immediately after sending the transfer, you must use the command 'get_tx_key' to retrieve the \
transaction private key. If you fail to perform this step, you may not be able to retrieve the key later. \n\n\
If you are using the Blur Network GUI Wallet, the transaction private key and transaction ID can be found conveniently \
in the "History" tab.  Immediately after sending, locate the transaction of interest. Click the "?" symbol in the \
lower-right corner of the box containing the transaction. You must save this information. \n\n\
In the event that arbitration is necessary, you must present the following to an mediator or arbitrator: 1.) the transaction ID, \
2.) the transaction private key, and 3.) the recipient's address.  The mediator or arbitrator will then verify the BLUR \
transfer using the Blur Transaction Viewer (https://blur.cash/#tx-viewer).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the mediator or arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
BLUR sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an mediator or arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the Blur Network Discord (https://discord.gg/dMWaqVW).

2.) the transaction private key, and 3.) the recipient's address.  The mediator or arbitrator will then verify the Solo \
transfer using the Solo Block Explorer by searching for the transaction and then using the "Prove sending" function (https://explorer.minesolo.com/).\n\n\
failure to provide the required information to the mediator or arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
Solo sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an mediator or arbitrator. \n\n\

transfer using the QWC Block Explorer (https://explorer.qwertycoin.org).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the mediator or arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
QWC sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an mediator or arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the QWC Discord (https://discord.gg/rUkfnpC).
account.altcoin.popup.drgl.msg=Trading Dragonglass on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
Because of the privacy Dragonglass provides, a transaction is not verifiable on the public blockchain. If required, you \
can prove your payment through the use of your TXN-Private-Key.\n\
The TXN-Private Key is a one-time key automatically generated for every transaction that can \
only be accessed from within your DRGL wallet.\n\
Either by DRGL-wallet GUI (inside transaction details dialog) or by the Dragonglass CLI simplewallet (using command "get_tx_key").\n\n\
DRGL version 'Oathkeeper' and higher are REQUIRED for both.\n\n\
In case of a dispute, you must provide the mediator or arbitrator the following data:\n\
- The TXN-Private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Verification of payment can be made using the above data as inputs at (http://drgl.info/#check_txn).\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The Dragonglass sender is responsible for providing verification of the DRGL transfer to the \
mediator or arbitrator in case of a dispute. Use of PaymentID is not required.\n\n\
If you are unsure about any part of this process, visit Dragonglass on Discord (http://discord.drgl.info) for help.
account.altcoin.popup.ZEC.msg=When using Zcash you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t), not \
the z-addresses (private), because the mediator or arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.
account.altcoin.popup.XZC.msg=When using Zcoin you can only use the transparent (traceable) addresses, not \
the untraceable addresses, because the mediator or arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with untraceable addresses at a block explorer.
account.altcoin.popup.grin.msg=GRIN requires an interactive process between the sender and receiver to create the \
  transaction. Be sure to follow the instructions from the GRIN project web page to reliably send and receive GRIN \
  (the receiver needs to be online or at least be online during a certain time frame). \n\n\
  Bisq supports only the Grinbox (Wallet713) wallet URL format. \n\n\
  The GRIN sender is required to provide proof that they have sent GRIN successfully. If the wallet cannot provide that proof, a \
  potential dispute will be resolved in favor of the GRIN receiver. Please be sure that you use the \
  latest Grinbox software which supports the transaction proof and that you understand the process of transferring and \
  receiving GRIN as well as how to create the proof. \n\n\
  See https://github.com/vault713/wallet713/blob/master/docs/usage.md#transaction-proofs-grinbox-only for more \
  information about the Grinbox proof tool.
account.altcoin.popup.beam.msg=BEAM requires an interactive process between the sender and receiver to create the \
  transaction. \n\n\
  Be sure to follow the instructions from the BEAM project web page to reliably send and receive BEAM \
  (the receiver needs to be online or at least be online during a certain time frame). \n\n\
  The BEAM sender is required to provide proof that they sent BEAM successfully. \
  Be sure to use wallet software which can produce such a proof. If the wallet cannot provide the proof a potential \
  dispute will be resolved in favor of the BEAM receiver.
account.altcoin.popup.pars.msg=Trading ParsiCoin on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
To send PARS you must use the official ParsiCoin Wallet version 3.0.0 or higher. \n\n\
You can Check your Transaction Hash and Transaction Key on Transactions Section on your GUI Wallet (ParsiPay) \
You need to right Click on the Transaction and then click on show details. \n\n\
In the event that arbitration is necessary, you must present the following to an mediator or arbitrator: 1) the Transaction Hash, \
2) the Transaction Key, and 3) the recipient's PARS address.  The mediator or arbitrator will then verify the PARS \
transfer using the ParsiCoin Block Explorer (http://explorer.parsicoin.net/#check_payment).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the mediator or arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
ParsiCoin sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an mediator or arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the ParsiCoin Discord (https://discord.gg/c7qmFNh).

account.altcoin.popup.blk-burnt.msg=To trade burnt blackcoins, you need to know the following:\n\n\
Burnt blackcoins are unspendable. To trade them on Bisq, output scripts need to be in the form: \
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA, followed by associated data bytes which, after being hex-encoded, constitute addresses. \
For example, burnt blackcoins with an address 666f6f (“foo” in UTF-8) will have the following script:\n\n\
OP_RETURN OP_PUSHDATA 666f6f\n\n\
To create burnt blackcoins, one may use the “burn” RPC command available in some wallets.\n\n\
For possible use cases, one may look at https://ibo.laboratorium.ee .\n\n\
As burnt blackcoins are unspendable, they can not be reselled. “Selling” burnt blackcoins means \
burning ordinary blackcoins (with associated data equal to the destination address).\n\n\
In case of a dispute, the BLK seller needs to provide the transaction hash.

account.seed.info=Please write down both wallet seed words and the date! \
You can recover your wallet any time with seed words and the date.\n\
The same seed words are used for the BTC and BSQ wallet.\n\n\
You should write down the seed words on a sheet of paper. Do not save them on your computer.\n\n\
Please note that the seed words are NOT a replacement for a backup.\n\
You need to create a backup of the whole application directory from the \"Account/Backup\" screen to recover application state and data.\n\
Importing seed words is only recommended for emergency cases. The application will not be functional without a proper backup of the database files and keys!
account.seed.warn.noPw.msg=You have not setup a wallet password which would protect the display of the seed words.\n\n\
Do you want to display the seed words?
account.seed.warn.noPw.yes=Yes, and don't ask me again
account.seed.enterPw=Enter password to view seed words
account.seed.restore.info=Please make a backup before applying restore from seed words. Be aware that wallet restore is \
  only for emergency cases and might cause problems with the internal wallet database.\n\
  It is not a way for applying a backup! Please use a backup from the application data directory for restoring a \
  previous application state.\n\n\
  After restoring the application will shut down automatically. After you have restarted the application it will resync \
  with the Bitcoin network. This can take a while and can consume a lot of CPU, especially if the wallet was older and \
  had many transactions. Please avoid interrupting that process, otherwise you might need to delete the SPV chain file \
  again or repeat the restore process.
account.seed.restore.ok=Ok, do the restore and shut down Bisq

to get in contact with the {1} buyer by using the provided email address or mobile number to verify that he or she \
  is really the owner of the Zelle (ClearXchange) account.

payment.moneyGram.info=When using MoneyGram the BTC buyer has to send the Authorisation number and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, country, state and the amount. The buyer will get displayed the seller's email in the trade process.
payment.westernUnion.info=When using Western Union the BTC buyer has to send the MTCN (tracking number) and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, city, country and the amount. The buyer will get displayed the seller's email in the trade process.
payment.halCash.info=When using HalCash the BTC buyer needs to send the BTC seller the HalCash code via a text message from their mobile phone.\n\n\
  Please make sure to not exceed the maximum amount your bank allows you to send with HalCash. \
  The min. amount per withdrawal is 10 EUR and the max. amount is 600 EUR. For repeated withdrawals it is \
  3000 EUR per receiver per day and 6000 EUR per receiver per month. Please cross check those limits with your \
  bank to be sure they use the same limits as stated here.\n\n\
  The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10 EUR as you cannot withdraw other amounts from an ATM. The \
  UI in the create-offer and take-offer screen will adjust the BTC amount so that the EUR amount is correct. You cannot use market \
  based price as the EUR amount would be changing with changing prices.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute the BTC buyer needs to provide the proof that they sent the EUR.
payment.limits.info=Please be aware that all bank transfers carry a certain amount of chargeback risk.\n\
  \n\
  To mitigate this risk, Bisq sets per-trade limits based on two factors:\n\
  \n\
  1. The estimated level of chargeback risk for the payment method used\n\
  2. The age of your account for that payment method\n\
  \n\
  The account you are creating now is new and its age is zero. As your account grows in age over a two-month period, your per-trade limits will grow along with it:\n\
  \n\
  ● During the 1st month, your per-trade limit will be {0}\n\
  ● During the 2nd month, your per-trade limit will be {1}\n\
  ● After the 2nd month, your per-trade limit will be {2}\n\
  \n\
  Please note that there are no limits on the total number of times you can trade.
payment.limits.info.withSigning=To limit chargeback risk, Bisq sets per-trade buy limits based on the following 2 factors:\n\
  \n\
  1. General chargeback risk for the payment method\n\
  2. Account signing status\n\
  \n\
  This payment account you just created carries some chargeback risk and is not yet signed by an arbitrator or trusted peer, \
  so it is limited to buying {0} per trade. \
  After it is signed, buy limits will increase as follows:\n\
  \n\
  ● Before signing, and up to 30 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {0}\n\
  ● 30 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {1}\n\
  ● 60 days after signing, your per-trade buy limit will be {2}\n\
  \n\
  Sell limits are not affected by account signing, and increase merely as account age increases. More information is at https://docs.bisq.network/payment-methods#account-signing.\n\
  \n\
  There are no limits on the number of trades you can make.

payment.cashDeposit.info=Please confirm your bank allows you to send cash deposits into other peoples' accounts. \
  For example, Bank of America and Wells Fargo no longer allow such deposits.

payment.revolut.info=Please be sure that the phone number you used for your Revolut account is registered at Revolut \
  otherwise the BTC buyer cannot send you the funds.

payment.usPostalMoneyOrder.info=Money orders are one of the more private fiat purchase methods available on Bisq.\n\n\
  However, please be aware of potentially increased risks associated with their use. Bisq will not bear any \
  responsibility in case a sent money order is stolen, and the mediator or arbitrator will in such cases award the BTC \
  to the sender of the money order, provided they can produce tracking information and receipts. \
  It may be advisable for the sender to write the BTC seller's name on the money order, in order to minimize the \
  risk that the money order is cashed by someone else.

payment.f2f.contact=Contact info
payment.f2f.contact.prompt=How you want to get contacted by the trading peer? (email address, phone number,...)
payment.f2f.city=City for 'Face to face' meeting
payment.f2f.city.prompt=The city will be displayed with the offer
payment.f2f.optionalExtra=Optional additional information
payment.f2f.extra=Additional information

payment.f2f.extra.prompt=The maker can define 'terms and conditions' or add a public contact information. It will be displayed with the offer.
payment.f2f.info='Face to Face' trades have different rules and come with different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  The main differences are:\n\
  ● The trading peers need to exchange information about the meeting location and time by using their provided contact details.\n\
  ● The trading peers need to bring their laptops and do the confirmation of 'payment sent' and 'payment received' at the meeting place.\n\
  ● If a maker has special 'terms and conditions' they must state those in the 'Additional information' text field in the account.\n\
  ● By taking an offer the taker agrees to the maker's stated 'terms and conditions'.\n\
  ● In case of a dispute the mediator or arbitrator cannot help much as it is usually hard to get tamper proof evidence of what \
  happened at the meeting. In such cases the BTC funds might get locked indefinitely or until the trading peers come to \
  an agreement.\n\n\
  To be sure you fully understand the differences with 'Face to Face' trades please read the instructions and \
  recommendations at: 'https://docs.bisq.network/trading-rules.html#f2f-trading'

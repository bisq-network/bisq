# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

support.backgroundInfo=Bisq is not a company, so it handles disputes differently.\n\n\
If there are disputes in the trade process (e.g. one trader does not follow the trade protocol) \
the application will display an \"Open dispute\" button after the trade period is over \
for contacting the arbitrator.\n\n\
If there is an issue with the application, the software will try to detect it and, if possible, display \
an \"Open support ticket\" button to contact the arbitrator who will forward the issue \
to the developers.\n\n\
If you are having an issue and did not see the \"Open support ticket\" button, \
you can open a support ticket manually by selecting the trade causing issues \
under \"Portfolio/Open trades\" and hitting \"alt + o\" or \"option + o\". \
Please use this method only if you are sure that the software is not working as expected. \
If you have problems or questions, please review the FAQ on the \
bisq.network web page or post in the Bisq forum in the Support section.

support.initialInfo=Please enter a description of your problem in the text field below. \
  Add as much information as possible to speed up dispute resolution time.\n\n\
  Here is a check list for information you should provide:\n\
  \t● If you are the BTC buyer: Did you make the Fiat or Altcoin transfer? If so, did you click the 'payment started' \
  button in the application?\n\
  \t● If you are the BTC seller: Did you receive the Fiat or Altcoin payment? If so, did you click the 'payment received' \
  button in the application?\n\
  \t● Which version of Bisq are you using?\n\
  \t● Which operating system are you using?\n\
  \t● If you encountered an issue with failed transactions please consider switching to a new data directory.\n\
  \t  Sometimes the data directory gets corrupted and leads to strange bugs. \n\
  \t  See: https://docs.bisq.network/backup-recovery.html#switch-to-a-new-data-directory\n\n\
  Please make yourself familiar with the basic rules for the dispute process:\n\
\t● You need to respond to the arbitrator's requests within 2 days.\n\
\t● The maximum period for a dispute is 14 days.\n\
\t● You need to cooperate with the arbitrator and provide the information they request to make your case.\n\
\t● You accepted the rules outlined in the dispute document in the user agreement when you first started the application.\n\n\

account.info.msg=Here you can add trading accounts for national currencies & altcoins, select arbitrators, and create a backup of your wallet & account data.\n\n\
A new Bitcoin wallet was created the first time you started Bisq.\n\n\
We strongly recommend that you write down your Bitcoin wallet seed words (see tab on the top) and consider adding a password before funding. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are managed in the \"Funds\" section.\n\n\
Privacy & security note: \
because Bisq is a decentralized exchange, all your data is kept on your computer. There are no servers, so we have no access to your personal info, your funds, or even your IP address. Data such as bank account numbers, altcoin & Bitcoin addresses, etc are only shared with your trading partner to fulfill trades you initiate (in case of a dispute the arbitrator will see the same data as your trading peer).

account.altcoin.popup.wallet.msg=Please be sure that you follow the requirements for the usage of {0} wallets as \
described on the {1} web page.\nUsing wallets from centralized exchanges where (a) you don''t control your keys or \
(b) which don''t use compatible wallet software is risky: it can lead to loss of the traded funds!\nThe arbitrator is \
not a {2} specialist and cannot help in such cases.
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.confirm=I understand and confirm that I know which wallet I need to use.
account.altcoin.popup.arq.msg=Trading ARQ on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending ARQ, you need to use either the official ArQmA GUI wallet or ArQmA CLI wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions). Please be sure you can access the tx key as \
that would be required in case of a dispute.\n\
arqma-wallet-cli (use the command get_tx_key)\n\
arqma-wallet-gui (go to history tab and click on the (P) button for payment proof)\n\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The ARQ sender is responsible for providing verification of the ARQ transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\
If you are not sure about that process visit ArQmA discord channel (https://discord.gg/s9BQpJT) \
or the ArQmA forum (https://labs.arqma.com) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=Trading XMR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending XMR, you need to use either the official Monero GUI wallet or Monero CLI wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions). Please be sure you can access the tx key as \
that would be required in case of a dispute.\n\
monero-wallet-cli (use the command get_tx_key)\n\
monero-wallet-gui (go to history tab and click on the (P) button for payment proof)\n\n\
In addition to XMR checktx tool (https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html) verification can also be accomplished in-wallet.\n\
monero-wallet-cli : using command (check_tx_key).\n\
monero-wallet-gui : on the Advanced > Prove/Check page.\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The XMR sender is responsible for providing verification of the XMR transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\

or the Monero forum (https://forum.getmonero.org) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.blur.msg=Trading BLUR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
To send BLUR you must use the Blur Network CLI or GUI Wallet. \n\n\
If you are using the CLI wallet, a transaction hash (tx ID) will be displayed after a transfer is sent. You must save \
this information. Immediately after sending the transfer, you must use the command 'get_tx_key' to retrieve the \
transaction private key. If you fail to perform this step, you may not be able to retrieve the key later. \n\n\
If you are using the Blur Network GUI Wallet, the transaction private key and transaction ID can be found conveniently \
in the "History" tab.  Immediately after sending, locate the transaction of interest. Click the "?" symbol in the \
lower-right corner of the box containing the transaction. You must save this information. \n\n\
In the event that arbitration is necessary, you must present the following to an arbitrator: 1.) the transaction ID, \
2.) the transaction private key, and 3.) the recipient's address.  The arbitrator will then verify the BLUR \
transfer using the Blur Transaction Viewer (https://blur.cash/#tx-viewer).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
BLUR sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the Blur Network Discord (https://discord.gg/dMWaqVW).
account.altcoin.popup.cash2.msg=Trading CASH2 on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
To send CASH2 you must use the Cash2 Wallet version 3 or higher. \n\n\
After a transaction is sent, the transaction ID will be displayed. You must save this information. \
Immediately after sending the transaction, you must use the command 'getTxKey' in simplewallet to retrieve the \
transaction secret key. \n\n\
In the event that arbitration is necessary, you must present the following to an arbitrator: 1) the transaction ID, \
2) the transaction secret key, and 3) the recipient's Cash2 address.  The arbitrator will then verify the CASH2 \
transfer using the Cash2 Block Explorer (https://blocks.cash2.org).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
CASH2 sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the Cash2 Discord (https://discord.gg/FGfXAYN).
account.altcoin.popup.drgl.msg=Trading Dragonglass on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
Because of the privacy Dragonglass provides, a transaction is not verifiable on the public blockchain. If required, you \
can prove your payment through the use of your TXN-Private-Key.\n\
The TXN-Private Key is a one-time key automatically generated for every transaction that can \
only be accessed from within your DRGL wallet.\n\
Either by DRGL-wallet GUI (inside transaction details dialog) or by the Dragonglass CLI simplewallet (using command "get_tx_key").\n\n\
DRGL version 'Oathkeeper' and higher are REQUIRED for both.\n\n\
In case of a dispute, you must provide the arbitrator the following data:\n\
- The TXN-Private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Verification of payment can be made using the above data as inputs at (http://drgl.info/#check_txn).\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The Dragonglass sender is responsible for providing verification of the DRGL transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute. Use of PaymentID is not required.\n\n\
If you are unsure about any part of this process, visit Dragonglass on Discord (http://discord.drgl.info) for help.
account.altcoin.popup.ZEC.msg=When using Zcash you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t) not \
the z-addresses (private), because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.
account.altcoin.popup.XZC.msg=When using Zcoin you can only use the transparent (traceable) addresses not \
the untraceable addresses, because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with untraceable addresses at a block explorer.
account.altcoin.popup.grin.msg=GRIN requires an interactive process between the sender and receiver to create the \
  transaction. Be sure to follow the instructions from the GRIN project web page to reliably send and receive GRIN \
  (the receiver needs to be online or at least be online during a certain time frame). \n\n\
  Bisq supports only the Grinbox (Wallet713) wallet URL format. \n\n\
  The GRIN sender is required to provide proof that they have sent GRIN successfully. If the wallet cannot provide that proof, a \
  potential dispute will be resolved in favor of the GRIN receiver. Please be sure that you use the \
  latest Grinbox software which supports the transaction proof and that you understand the process of transferring and \
  receiving GRIN as well as how to create the proof. \n\n\
  See https://github.com/vault713/wallet713/blob/master/docs/usage.md#transaction-proofs-grinbox-only for more \
  information about the Grinbox proof tool.
account.altcoin.popup.beam.msg=BEAM requires an interactive process between the sender and receiver to create the \
  transaction. \n\n\
  Be sure to follow the instructions from the BEAM project web page to reliably send and receive BEAM \
  (the receiver needs to be online or at least be online during a certain time frame). \n\n\
  The BEAM sender is required to provide proof that they sent BEAM successfully. \
  Be sure to use wallet software which can produce such a proof. If the wallet cannot provide the proof a potential \
  dispute will be resolved in favor of the BEAM receiver.

account.seed.info=Please write down both wallet seed words and the date! \
You can recover your wallet any time with seed words and the date.\n\
The same seed words are used for the BTC and BSQ wallet.\n\n\
You should write down the seed words on a sheet of paper. Do not save them on your computer.\n\n\
Please note that the seed words are NOT a replacement for a backup.\n\
You need to create a backup of the whole application directory from the \"Account/Backup\" screen to recover application state and data.\n\
Importing seed words is only recommended for emergency cases. The application will not be functional without a proper backup of the database files and keys!
account.seed.warn.noPw.msg=You have not setup a wallet password which would protect the display of the seed words.\n\n\
Do you want to display the seed words?
account.seed.warn.noPw.yes=Yes, and don't ask me again
account.seed.enterPw=Enter password to view seed words
account.seed.restore.info=Please make a backup before applying restore from seed words. Be aware that wallet restore is \
  only for emergency cases and might cause problems with the internal wallet database.\n\
  It is not a way for applying a backup! Please use a backup from the application data directory for restoring a \
  previous application state.\n\n\
  After restoring the application will shut down automatically. After you have restarted the application it  will resync \
  with the Bitcoin network. This can take a while and can consume a lot fo CPU, specially if the wallet was older and \
  had many transactions. Please avoid to interrupt that process, otherwise you might need to delete the SPV chain file \
  again or repeat the restore process.
account.seed.restore.ok=Ok, do the restore and shut down Bisq

2. You need to have a bank account at one of the following member banks:\n\

3. You need to be sure to not exceed the daily or monthly Zelle (ClearXchange) transfer limits.\n\n\
Please use Zelle (ClearXchange) only if you fulfill all those requirements, \
otherwise it is very likely that the Zelle (ClearXchange) transfer fails and the trade ends up in a dispute.\n\
If you have not fulfilled the above requirements you will lose your security deposit.\n\n\
  Please also be aware of a higher chargeback risk when using Zelle (ClearXchange).\n\
  For the {0} seller it is highly recommended \
to get in contact with the {1} buyer by using the provided email address or mobile number to verify that he or she \
  is really the owner of the Zelle (ClearXchange) account.

payment.moneyGram.info=When using MoneyGram the BTC buyer has to send the Authorisation number and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, country, state and the amount. The buyer will get displayed the seller's email in the trade process.

  Please make sure to not exceed the maximum amount your bank allows you to send with HalCash. \
  The min. amount per withdrawal is 10 EUR and the max. amount is 600 EUR. For repeated withdrawals it is \
  3000 EUR per receiver per day and 6000 EUR per receiver per month. Please cross check those limits with your \
  bank to be sure they use the same limits as stated here.\n\n\
  The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10 EUR as you cannot withdraw other amounts from an ATM. The \
  UI in the create-offer and take-offer screen will adjust the BTC amount so that the EUR amount is correct. You cannot use market \
  based price as the EUR amount would be changing with changing prices.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute the BTC buyer needs to provide the proof that they sent the EUR.
payment.limits.info=Please be aware that all bank transfers carry a certain amount of chargeback risk.\n\
  \n\
  To mitigate this risk, Bisq sets per-trade limits based on two factors:\n\
  \n\
  1. The estimated level of chargeback risk for the payment method used\n\
  2. The age of your account for that payment method\n\
  \n\
  The account you are creating now is new and its age is zero. As your account grows in age over a two-month period, your per-trade limits will grow along with it:\n\
  \n\

payment.f2f.info='Face to Face' trades have different rules and come with different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  The main differences are:\n\
  ● The trading peers need to exchange information about the meeting location and time by using their provided contact details.\n\
  ● The trading peers need to bring their laptops and do the confirmation of 'payment sent' and 'payment received' at the meeting place.\n\
  ● If a maker has special 'terms and conditions' they must state those in the 'Additional information' text field in the account.\n\
  ● By taking an offer the taker agrees to the maker's stated 'terms and conditions'.\n\
  ● In case of a dispute the arbitrator cannot help much as it is usually hard to get tamper proof evidence of what \
  happened at the meeting. In such cases the BTC funds might get locked indefinitely or until the trading peers come to \
  an agreement.\n\n\
  To be sure you fully understand the differences with 'Face to Face' trades please read the instructions and \
  recommendations at: 'https://docs.bisq.network/trading-rules.html#f2f-trading'

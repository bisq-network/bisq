# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to English. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

support.backgroundInfo=Bisq is not a company, so it handles disputes differently.\n\n\
If there are disputes in the trade process (e.g. one trader does not follow the trade protocol) \
the application will display an \"Open dispute\" button after the trade period is over \
for contacting the arbitrator.\n\n\
If there is an issue with the application, the software will try to detect it and, if possible, display \
an \"Open support ticket\" button to contact the arbitrator who will forward the issue \
to the developers.\n\n\
If you are having an issue and did not see the \"Open support ticket\" button, \
you can open a support ticket manually by selecting the trade causing issues \
under \"Portfolio/Open trades\" and hitting \"alt + o\" or \"option + o\". \
Please use this method only if you are sure that the software is not working as expected. \
If you have problems or questions, please review the FAQ on the \
bisq.network web page or post in the Bisq forum in the Support section.

support.initialInfo=Please note the basic rules for the dispute process:\n\
1. You need to respond to the arbitrator's requests within 2 days.\n\
2. The maximum period for a dispute is 14 days.\n\
3. You need to cooperate with the arbitrator and provide the information they request to make your case.\n\
4. You accepted the rules outlined in the wiki in the user agreement when you first started the application.\n\n\

account.info.headline=Welcome to your Bisq Account
account.info.msg=Here you can add trading accounts for national currencies & altcoins, select arbitrators, and create a backup of your wallet & account data.\n\n\
A new Bitcoin wallet was created the first time you started Bisq.\n\n\
We strongly recommend that you write down your Bitcoin wallet seed words (see tab on the top) and consider adding a password before funding. Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals are managed in the \"Funds\" section.\n\n\
Privacy & security note: \
because Bisq is a decentralized exchange, all your data is kept on your computer. There are no servers, so we have no access to your personal info, your funds, or even your IP address. Data such as bank account numbers, altcoin & Bitcoin addresses, etc are only shared with your trading partner to fulfill trades you initiate (in case of a dispute the arbitrator will see the same data as your trading peer).

account.arbitratorRegistration.info.msg=Please note that you need to stay available for 15 days after revoking as there might be trades which are using you as arbitrator. The max. allowed trade period is 8 days and the dispute process might take up to 7 days.
account.arbitratorRegistration.warn.min1Language=You need to set at least 1 language.\nWe added the default language for you.

account.altcoin.yourAltcoinAccounts=Your altcoin accounts
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.msg=Please be sure that you follow the requirements for the usage of {0} wallets as \
described on the {1} web page.\nUsing wallets from centralized exchanges where (a) you don''t control your keys or \
(b) which don''t use compatible wallet software is risky: it can lead to loss of the traded funds!\nThe arbitrator is \
not a {2} specialist and cannot help in such cases.
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.confirm=I understand and confirm that I know which wallet I need to use.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=Trading XMR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending XMR, you need to use either the official Monero GUI wallet or Monero CLI wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions). Please be sure you can access the tx key as \
that would be required in case of a dispute.\n\
monero-wallet-cli (use the command get_tx_key)\n\
monero-wallet-gui (go to history tab and click on the (P) button for payment proof)\n\n\
In addition to XMR checktx tool (https://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html) verification can also be accomplished in-wallet.\n\
monero-wallet-cli : using command (check_tx_key).\n\
monero-wallet-gui : on the Advanced > Prove/Check page.\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The XMR sender is responsible for providing verification of the XMR transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\
If you are not sure about that process visit (https://www.getmonero.org/resources/user-guides/prove-payment.html) \
or the Monero forum (https://forum.getmonero.org) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.blur.msg=Trading BLUR on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
To send BLUR you must use the Blur Network CLI or GUI Wallet. \n\n\
If you are using the CLI wallet, a transaction hash (tx ID) will be displayed after a transfer is sent. You must save \
this information. Immediately after sending the transfer, you must use the command 'get_tx_key' to retrieve the \
transaction private key. If you fail to perform this step, you may not be able to retrieve the key later. \n\n\
If you are using the Blur Network GUI Wallet, the transaction private key and transaction ID can be found conveniently \
in the "History" tab.  Immediately after sending, locate the transaction of interest. Click the "?" symbol in the \
lower-right corner of the box containing the transaction. You must save this information. \n\n\
In the event that arbitration is necessary, you must present the following to an arbitrator: 1.) the transaction ID, \
2.) the transaction private key, and 3.) the recipient's address.  The arbitrator will then verify the BLUR \
transfer using the Blur Transaction Viewer (https://blur.cash/#tx-viewer).\n\n\
Failure to provide the required information to the arbitrator will result in losing the dispute case. In all cases of dispute, the \
BLUR sender bears 100% of the burden of responsibility in verifying transactions to an arbitrator. \n\n\
If you do not understand these requirements, do not trade on Bisq. First, seek help at the Blur Network Discord (https://discord.gg/dMWaqVW).
account.altcoin.popup.drgl.msg=Trading Dragonglass on Bisq requires that you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
Because of the privacy Dragonglass provides, a transaction is not verifiable on the public blockchain. If required, you \
can prove your payment through the use of your TXN-Private-Key.\n\
The TXN-Private Key is a one-time key automatically generated for every transaction that can \
only be accessed from within your DRGL wallet.\n\
Either by DRGL-wallet GUI (inside transaction details dialog) or by the Dragonglass CLI simplewallet (using command "get_tx_key").\n\n\
DRGL version 'Oathkeeper' and higher are REQUIRED for both.\n\n\
In case of a dispute, you must provide the arbitrator the following data:\n\
- The TXN-Private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
Verification of payment can be made using the above data as inputs at (http://drgl.info/#check_txn).\n\n\
Failure to provide the above data, or if you used an incompatible wallet, will result in losing the \
dispute case. The Dragonglass sender is responsible for providing verification of the DRGL transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute. Use of PaymentID is not required.\n\n\
If you are unsure about any part of this process, visit Dragonglass on Discord (http://discord.drgl.info) for help.
account.altcoin.popup.ZEC.msg=When using Zcash you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t) not \
the z-addresses (private), because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.
account.altcoin.popup.XZC.msg=When using Zcoin you can only use the transparent (traceable) addresses not \
the untraceable addresses, because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with untraceable addresses at a block explorer.

account.seed.restore.info=Please make a backup before applying restore from seed words. Be aware that wallet restore is \

  previous application state.

2. You need to have a bank account at one of the following member banks:\n\
\t● Bank of America\n\
\t● Capital One P2P Payments\n\

\t● FirstBank Person to Person Transfers\n\

\t● Wells Fargo SurePay\n\n\
3. You need to be sure to not exceed the daily or monthly Zelle (ClearXchange) transfer limits.\n\n\
Please use Zelle (ClearXchange) only if you fulfill all those requirements, \
otherwise it is very likely that the Zelle (ClearXchange) transfer fails and the trade ends up in a dispute.\n\
If you have not fulfilled the above requirements you will lose your security deposit.\n\n\
  Please also be aware of a higher chargeback risk when using Zelle (ClearXchange).\n\
  For the {0} seller it is highly recommended \
to get in contact with the {1} buyer by using the provided email address or mobile number to verify that he or she \
  is really the owner of the Zelle (ClearXchange) account.

payment.moneyGram.info=When using MoneyGram the BTC buyer has to send the Authorisation number and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, country, state and the amount. The buyer will get displayed the seller's email in the trade process.
payment.westernUnion.info=When using Western Union the BTC buyer has to send the MTCN (tracking number) and a photo of the receipt by email to the BTC seller. \
  The receipt must clearly show the seller's full name, city, country and the amount. The buyer will get displayed the seller's email in the trade process.
payment.halCash.info=When using HalCash the BTC buyer needs to send the BTC seller the HalCash code via a text message from their mobile phone.\n\n\
  Please make sure to not exceed the maximum amount your bank allows you to send with HalCash. \
  The min. amount per withdrawal is 10 EUR and the max. amount is 600 EUR. For repeated withdrawals it is \
  3000 EUR per receiver per day and 6000 EUR per receiver per month. Please cross check those limits with your \
  bank to be sure they use the same limits as stated here.\n\n\
  The withdrawal amount must be a multiple of 10 EUR as you cannot withdraw other amounts from an ATM. The \
  UI in the create-offer and take-offer screen will adjust the BTC amount so that the EUR amount is correct. You cannot use market \
  based price as the EUR amount would be changing with changing prices.\n\n\
  In case of a dispute the BTC buyer needs to provide the proof that they sent the EUR.
payment.limits.info=Please be aware that all bank transfers carry a certain amount of chargeback risk.\n\
  \n\
  To mitigate this risk, Bisq sets per-trade limits based on two factors:\n\
  \n\
  1. The estimated level of chargeback risk for the payment method used\n\
  2. The age of your account for that payment method\n\
  \n\
  The account you are creating now is new and its age is zero. As your account grows in age over a two-month period, your per-trade limits will grow along with it:\n\
  \n\
  ● During the 1st month, your per-trade limit will be {0}\n\
  ● During the 2nd month, your per-trade limit will be {1}\n\
  ● After the 2nd month, your per-trade limit will be {2}\n\
  \n\
  Please note that there are no limits on the total number of times you can trade.

payment.cashDeposit.info=Please confirm your bank allows you to send cash deposits into other peoples' accounts. \
  For example, Bank of America and Wells Fargo no longer allow such deposits.

payment.f2f.city.prompt=The city will be displayed with the offer
payment.f2f.optionalExtra=Optional additional information
payment.f2f.extra=Additional information

payment.f2f.extra.prompt=The maker can define 'terms and conditions' or add a public contact information. It will be displayed with the offer.
payment.f2f.info='Face to Face' trades have different rules and come with different risks than online transactions.\n\n\
  The main differences are:\n\
  ● The trading peers need to exchange information about the meeting location and time by using their provided contact details.\n\
  ● The trading peers need to bring their laptops and do the confirmation of 'payment sent' and 'payment received' at the meeting place.\n\
  ● If a maker has special 'terms and conditions' they must state those in the 'Additional information' text field in the account.\n\
  ● By taking an offer the taker agrees to the maker's stated 'terms and conditions'.\n\
  ● In case of a dispute the arbitrator cannot help much as it is usually hard to get tamper proof evidence of what \
  happened at the meeting. In such cases the BTC funds might get locked indefinitely or until the trading peers come to \
  an agreement.\n\n\
  To be sure you fully understand the differences with 'Face to Face' trades please read the instructions and \
  recommendations at: 'https://docs.bisq.network/trading-rules.html#f2f-trading'

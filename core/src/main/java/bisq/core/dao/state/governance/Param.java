/**
 * All parameters in the Bisq DAO which can be changed by voting.
 * We will add more on demand.
 * We need to support updates with new types in future. We use in the persisted data only the enum name, thus the names
 * must not change once the dao has started. Default values must not be changed as well.
 * For parameters which are used by Bisq users (trade fee,...) we have more strict requirements for backward compatibility.
 * Parameters which are only used in proposals and voting are less strict limited as we can require that those users are
 * using the latest software version.
 * The UNDEFINED entry is used as fallback for error cases and will get ignored.

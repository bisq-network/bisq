/**
 * Data here must not be changed as it would break backward compatibility! In case we need to change we need to add a
 * new entry and maintain the old one. Once all the role holders of an old deprecated role have revoked the
 * role might get removed.
 *
 * Add entry to translation file "dao.bond.bondedRoleType...."
 *
 * Name of the BondedRoleType must not change as that is used for serialisation in Protobuffer. The data fields are not part of
 * the PB serialisation so changes for those would not change the hash for the dao state hash chain.
 * As the data is not used in consensus critical code yet changing fields can be tolerated.
 * For mediators and arbitrators we will use automated verification of the bond so there might be issues when we change
 * the values. So lets avoid changing anything here beside adding new entries.

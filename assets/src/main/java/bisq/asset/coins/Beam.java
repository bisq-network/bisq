/**
 * Here is info from a Beam developer regarding validation.
 *
 * Well, unfortunately the range length is quite large. The BbsChannel is 64 bit = 8 bytes, the pubkey is 32 bytes.
 * So, the length may be up to 80 chars. The minimum length "theoretically" can also drop to a small length, if the
 * channel==0, and the pubkey starts with many zeroes  (very unlikely, but possible). So, besides being up to 80 chars
 * lower-case hex there's not much can be tested. A more robust test would also check if the pubkey is indeed valid,
 * but it's a more complex test, requiring cryptographic code.

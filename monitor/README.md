# Bisq Network Monitor Node

The Bisq monitor node collects a set of metrics which are of interest to developers and users alike. These metrics are then made available through reporters.

The *Settled* release features these metrics:
- Tor Startup Time: The time it takes to start Tor starting at a clean system, unpacking the shipped Tor binaries, firing up Tor until Tor is connected to the Tor network and ready to use.
- Tor Roundtrip Time: Given a bootstrapped Tor, the roundtrip time of connecting to a hidden service is measured.
- Tor Hidden Service Startup Time: Given a bootstrapped Tor, the time it takes to create and announce a freshly created hidden service.
- P2P Round Trip Time: A metric hitchhiking the Ping/Pong messages of the Keep-Alive-Mechanism to determine the Round Trip Time when issuing a Ping to a seed node.
- P2P Seed Node Message Snapshot: Get absolute number and constellation of messages a fresh Bisq client will get on startup. Also reports diffs between seed nodes on a per-message-type basis.
- P2P Network Load: listens to the P2P network and its broadcast messages. Reports every X seconds.
- P2P Market Statistics: a demonstration metric which extracts market information from broadcast messages. This demo implementation reports the number of open offers per market .


The *Settled* release features these reporters:
- A reporter that simply writes the findings to `System.err`
- A reporter that reports the findings to a Graphite/Carbon instance using the [plaintext protocol](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol)

## Configuration

The *Bisq Network Monitor Node* is to be configured via a Java properties file. There is a default configuration file shipped with the monitor which reports to the one monitoring service currently up and running.

If you want to tweak the configuration, you can pass the location of the file as command line parameter:

```
./bisq-monitor /path/to/your/config.properties
```

A sample configuration file looks like follows:

```
## System configuration

# true overwrites the reporters picked by the developers (for debugging for example) (defaults to false)
System.useConsoleReporter=true

# 0 -> BTC_MAINNET, 1 -> BTC_TESTNET (default)
System.baseCurrencyNetwork=0

## Each Metric is configured via a set of properties.
##
## The minimal set of properties required to run a Metric is:
##
## YourMetricName.enabled=true|false
## YourMetricName.run.interval=10 [seconds]

#Edit and uncomment the lines below to your liking

#TorStartupTime Metric
TorStartupTime.enabled=true
TorStartupTime.run.interval=100
TorStartupTime.run.socksPort=90500 # so that there is no interference with a system Tor

TorRoundTripTime.run.interval=100
TorRoundTripTime.run.sampleSize=5
TorRoundTripTime.run.hosts=http://expyuzz4wqqyqhjn.onion:80 # torproject.org hidden service

#TorHiddenServiceStartupTime Metric
TorHiddenServiceStartupTime.enabled=true
TorHiddenServiceStartupTime.run.interval=100
TorHiddenServiceStartupTime.run.localPort=90501 # so that there is no interference with a system Tor

#MarketStats Metric
MarketStats.enabled=true
MarketStats.run.interval=191

## Reporters are configured via a set of properties as well.
##
## In contrast to Metrics, Reporters do not have a minimal set of properties.

#GraphiteReporter
GraphiteReporter.serviceUrl=k6evlhg44acpchtc.onion:2003

```

## Run

The distribution ships with a systemd .desktop file. Validate/change the executable/config paths within the shipped `bisq-monitor.service` file and copy/move the file to your systemd directory (something along `/usr/lib/systemd/system/`). Now you can control your *Monitor Node* via the usual systemd start/stop commands

```
systemctl start bisq-monitor.service
systemctl stop bisq-monitor.service
```
and
```
systemctl enable bisq-monitor.service
```

You can reload the configuration without restarting the service by using

```
systemctl reload bisq-monitor.service
```

Follow the logs created by the service by inspecting

```
journalctl --unit bisq-monitor --follow
```

# Monitoring Service

A typical monitoring service consists of a [Graphite](https://graphiteapp.org/) and a [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) instance.
Both are available via Docker-containers.

## Setting up Graphite

### Install

For a docker setup, use

```
docker run -d --name graphite --restart=always -p 2003:2003 -p 8080:8080 graphiteapp/graphite-statsd
```

- Port 2003 is used for the [plaintext protocol](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol) mentioned above
- Port 8080 offers an API for user interfaces.

more information can be found [here](https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html)

### Configuration

For configuration, you must adapt the whisper database schema to suit your needs. First, stop your docker container by running

```
docker stop graphite
```

Find your config files within the `Source` directory stated in

```
docker inspect graphite | grep -C 2 graphite/conf\",
```

Edit `storage-schemas.conf` so that the frequency of your incoming data (configured in the monitor configs `interval`) is matched. For example, insert 
```
[bisq]
pattern = ^bisq.*
retentions = 10s:1h,5m:31d,30m:2y,1h:5y
```
before the `[default...` blocks of the file. This basically says, that every incoming set of data reflects 5 minutes of the time series. Furthermore, every 30 minutes, the data is compressed and thus, takes less memory as it is kept for 2 years.

Further, edit `storage-aggregation.conf` to configure how your data is compressed. For example, insert
```
[bisq]
pattern=^bisq.*
xFilesFactor = 0
aggregationMethod = average
```
before the `[default...` blocks of the file. With this configuration, whenever data is aggregated, the `average` data is made available given that at least `0%` of the data points (i.e. floor(30 / 5 * 40%) = 2 data points) exist. Otherwise, the aggregated data is dropped. Since we start the first hour with a frequency of 10s but only supply data every 4 to 6 minutes, our aggregated values would get dropped.

*Please note, that I have not been able to get the whole thing to work without the 10s:1h part yet*

Finally, update the database. For doing that, go to the storage directory of graphite, the `Source` directory stated in
```
docker inspect graphite | grep -C 2 graphite/conf\",
```
Once there, you have two options:
- delete the whisper directory
```
rm -r whisper
```
- update the database by doing
```
find ./ -type f -name '*.wsp' -exec whisper-resize.py --nobackup {} 10s:1h 5m:31d 30m:2y 1h:5y \;
```

and finally, restart your graphite container:
```
docker start graphite
```


Other than that, there is no further configuration necessary. However, you might change your iptables/firewalls to not let anyone access your Graphite instance from the outside.

### Backup your data

The metric data is kept in the `Source` directory stated in
```
docker inspect graphite | grep -C 2 graphite/conf\",
```
ready to be backed up regularly.

## Setting up Grafana

### Install

For a docker setup, use

```
docker run -d --name=grafana -p 3000:3000 grafana/grafana
```

- Port 3000 offers the web interface

more information can be found [here](https://grafana.com/grafana/download?platform=docker)

### Configuration

- Once you have Grafana up and running, go to the *Data Source* configuration tab.
- Once there click *Add data source* and select *Graphite*.
- In the HTTP section enter the IP address of your graphite docker container and the port `8080` (as we have configured before). E.g. `http://172.170.1:8080`
- Select `Server (default)` as an *Access* method and hit *Save & Test*.

You should be all set. You can now proceed to add Dashboards, Panels and finally display the prettiest Graphs you can think of.
A working connection to Graphite should let you add your data series in a *Graph*s *Metrics* tab in a pretty intuitive way.

- Optional: hide your Grafana instance behind a reverse proxy like nginx and add some TLS.
- Optional: make your Grafana instance accessible via a Tor hidden service.

### Backup your data

Grafana stores every dashboard as a JSON model. This model can be accessed (copied/restored) within the dashboards settings and its *JSON Model* tab. Do with the data whatever you want.

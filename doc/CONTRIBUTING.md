Contributing to Bisq
============================

Pull requests
--------------------

To contribute a patch, the workflow is as follows:

  - Fork repository
  - Create topic branch from `master` branch
  - Commit patches

Submit your pull request from your topic branch to the `master` branch.


Workflow for merging code
---------

We are aiming to follow the principles and establish the workflow used at the Bitcoin Core project.
Please check out the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more info.
The full workflow is not used yet as there are not that many dedicated developers yet, but as soon that situation changes we will move
to a model with ACK/NACK, code reviews and maintainer roles.

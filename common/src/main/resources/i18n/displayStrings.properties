# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise  the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to english. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

you can open a support ticket manually with a special short cut.\n\n\
Please use that only if you are sure that the software is not working like expected. \
If you have problems how to use Bisq or any questions please review the FAQ at the \
bisq.network web page or post in the Bisq forum at the support section.\n\n\

the support ticket.

Bisq is a decentralized exchange – meaning all of your data is kept on your computer, there are no servers and we have no access to your personal info, your funds or even your IP address.

described on the {1} web page.\nUsing wallets from centralized exchanges where you don''t have your keys under \
your control or using a not compatible wallet software can lead to loss of the traded funds!\nThe arbitrator is \
not a {2} specialist and cannot help in such cases.
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.confirm=I understand and confirm that I know which wallet I need to use.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=If you want to trade XMR on Bisq please be sure you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending XMR you need to use either the official Monero GUI wallet or the Monero simple wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions).\n\
Please be sure that you can access the tx key (use the get_tx_key command in simplewallet) as that \
would be required in case of a dispute to enable the arbitrator to verify the XMR transfer with \
the XMR checktx tool (http://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html).\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
If you cannot provide the above data or if you used an incompatible wallet it would result in losing the \
dispute case. The XMR sender is responsible to be able to verify the XMR transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\n\
If you are not sure about that process visit the Monero forum (https://forum.getmonero.org) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.transparentTx.msg=When using {0} you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t) not \
the z-addresses (private), because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.
account.altcoin.popup.bch=Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin Clashic suffer from replay protection. If you use those coins be sure you take sufficient precautions and understand all implications.\
You can suffer losses by sending one coin and unintentionally send the same coins on the other block chain.\
  Because those "airdrop coins" share the same history with the Bitcoin blockchain there are also security risks and a considerable risk for losing privacy.\n\n\
  Please read at the Bisq Forum more about that topic: https://forum.bisq.io/t/airdrop-coins-information-thread-bch-btg-bchc
account.altcoin.popup.btg=Because Bitcoin Gold shares the same history as the Bitcoin blockchain it comes with certain security risks and a considerable risk for losing privacy.\

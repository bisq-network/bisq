# Keep display strings organized by domain
# Naming convention: We use camelCase and dot separated name spaces.
# Use as many sub spaces as required to make the structure clear, but as little as possible.
# E.g.: [main-view].[component].[description]
# In some cases we use enum values or constants to map to display strings

# A annoying issue with property files is that we need to use 2 single quotes in display string
# containing variables (e.g. {0}), otherwise  the variable will not be resolved.
# In display string which do not use a variable a single quote is ok.
# E.g. Don''t .... {1}

# We use sometimes dynamic parts which are put together in the code and therefore sometimes use line breaks or spaces
# at the end of the string. Please never remove any line breaks or spaces. They are there with a purpose!
# To make longer strings with better readable you can make a line break with \ which does not result in a line break
# in the display but only in the editor.

# Please use in all language files the exact same order of the entries, that way a comparison is easier.

# Please try to keep the length of the translated string similar to english. If it is longer it might break layout or
# get truncated. We will need some adjustments in the UI code to support that but we want to keep effort at the minimum.

described on the {1} web page.\nUsing wallets from centralized exchanges where you don''t have your keys under \
your control or using a not compatible wallet software can lead to loss of the traded funds!\nThe arbitrator is \
not a {2} specialist and cannot help in such cases.
account.altcoin.popup.wallet.confirm=I understand and confirm that I know which wallet I need to use.
account.altcoin.popup.xmr.msg=If you want to trade XMR on Bisq please be sure you understand and fulfill \
the following requirements:\n\n\
For sending XMR you need to use either the official Monero GUI wallet or the Monero simple wallet with the \
store-tx-info flag enabled (default in new versions).\n\
Please be sure that you can access the tx key (use the get_tx_key command in simplewallet) as that \
would be required in case of a dispute to enable the arbitrator to verify the XMR transfer with \
the XMR checktx tool (http://xmr.llcoins.net/checktx.html).\n\
At normal block explorers the transfer is not verifiable.\n\n\
You need to provide the arbitrator the following data in case of a dispute:\n\
- The tx private key\n\
- The transaction hash\n\
- The recipient's public address\n\n\
If you cannot provide the above data or if you used an incompatible wallet it would result in losing the \
dispute case. The XMR sender is responsible to be able to verify the XMR transfer to the \
arbitrator in case of a dispute.\n\n\
There is no payment ID required, just the normal public address.\n\n\
If you are not sure about that process visit the Monero forum (https://forum.getmonero.org) to find more information.
account.altcoin.popup.transparentTx.msg=When using {0} you can only use the transparent addresses (starting with t) not \
the z-addresses (private), because the arbitrator would not be able to verify the transaction with z-addresses.

Please note that the seed words are NOT a replacement for a backup.\n\
You need to backup the whole application directory at the \"Account/Backup\" screen to recover the valid application state and data.\n\
Importing seed words is only recommended for emergency cases. The application will not be functional without a proper backup of the database files and keys!

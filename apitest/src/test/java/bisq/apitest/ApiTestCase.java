/**
 * Base class for all test types:  'method', 'scenario' and 'e2e'.
 * <p>
 * During scaffold setup, various combinations of bitcoind and bisq instances
 * can be started in the background before test cases are run.  Currently, this test
 * harness supports only the "Bisq DAO development environment running against a
 * local Bitcoin regtest network" as described in
 * <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dev-setup.md">dev-setup.md</a>
 * and <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.md">dao-setup.md</a>.
 * <p>
 * Those documents contain information about the configurations used by this test harness:
 * bitcoin-core's bitcoin.conf and blocknotify values, bisq instance options, the DAO genesis
 * transaction id, initial BSQ and BTC balances for Bob & Alice accounts, and default
 * PerfectMoney dummy payment accounts (USD) for Bob and Alice.
 * <p>
 * During a build, the
 * <a href="https://github.com/bisq-network/bisq/blob/master/docs/dao-setup.zip">dao-setup.zip</a>
 * file is downloaded and extracted if necessary.  In each test case's @BeforeClass
 * method, the DAO setup files are re-installed into the run time's data directories
 * (each test case runs on a refreshed DAO/regtest environment setup).
 * <p>
 * Initial Alice balances & accounts:  10.0 BTC, 1000000.00 BSQ, USD PerfectMoney dummy
 * <p>
 * Initial Bob balances & accounts:    10.0 BTC, 1500000.00 BSQ, USD PerfectMoney dummy
